## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC, MinGW, or Visual Studio)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming
- Git installed on your system

## Required Concepts to Apply 
Your system must include and demonstrate the following:
1. Functions
    - Use modular functions for each major operation (e.g., addRecord(), deleteRecord(), searchRecord(), saveToFile(), loadFromFile(), etc.).
    - Avoid writing everything in the main() function.
2. Abstract Data Types (ADT)
    - Implement your own user-defined data structures using class. Apply 3-file structure.
3. Pointers
    - Use pointers for dynamic memory allocation, parameter passing, or navigating linked lists.
4. Linked List
    - Use a singly or doubly linked list to manage a dynamic collection of records.
5. Stack or Queue
    - Use either a stack (e.g., undo actions, navigation history) or a queue (e.g., customer waiting list, order queue).
6. File Handling
    - Your system must be able to:
        * Store data persistently in text files.
        * Retrieve and display data from the files when the program runs again.
